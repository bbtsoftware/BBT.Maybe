# Why does BBT.Maybe exist?

Introduction to BBT.Maybe, what problems are solved and how it's distinctive from other functional option type implementations.

BBT.Maybe is an implementation of the functional option type pattern.

## Features

* Makes nullable references explicit
* Prevents null reference exceptions on reference calls
* Provides an option type with broad usage over all layers of code

## Advantages over similar libraries

* Prevents access to null value, therefore no direct access is offered.
* Implementation of maybe for both optional reference and nullable value types
* Reduction to core functionality prevents bloated feature set
* Usage of maybe in communication layer
